## Introduction

Berserker Chess introduces a revolutionary concept: an immortal Knight (the Berserker). It moves and captures just like a regular Knight but with special rules when captured. The Berserker is an agent of chaos - you can love, hate, or fear him, but he can't be ignored.

## Requirements

- A standard chess set
- A way to distinguish the white and black Berserker Knights (ribbon, platform, or marker)

## Rules

### Opening Phase

1. The game begins as a normal chess game with all pieces regular Knights in play.

### Release the Berserker

When a player's piece enters rows 4-5 (the center line), a transformation occurs:

1. After the moving player's turn ends, their opponent MUST use their next turn to select which of the moving player's Knights becomes the Berserker
2. The opponent must choose from the moving player's remaining Knights on the board:
   - If only one Knight remains, it automatically becomes the Berserker
   - A captured Knight cannot be selected
3. The selected Knight is marked as a Berserker and play continues normally
4. Each player can only trigger one transformation during the game - subsequent crossings have no effect
5. Note: Once ANY piece crosses the center line, the transformation must occur - even if the piece later moves back

### Berserker Capture Rules

When a Berserker is captured, the capturing player immediately makes a mandatory move placing the Berserker on its owner's starting rank (rank 1 for White, rank 8 for Black) under these restrictions:

1. The landing square cannot be occupied and cannot threaten any of the Berserker owner's pieces when repositioned
2. The landing square can be under attack by enemy pieces (the Berserker is immortal after all)
3. If no valid squares exist on the starting rank, place the Berserker on the pawn rank (rank 2 for White, rank 7 for Black) under the same restrictions
4. If still no valid squares exist, the Berserker may be placed on rank 3 (White) or rank 6 (Black)
5. This placement is mandatory and counts as the capturing player's move

### The Oh No! Rule (Eric's Rule)

- Each player gets ONE take-back move per game
- Player must announce: "Oh no, my [piece]!" and immediately take back their last move
- Can only be used immediately after your move and before your opponent moves
- Can be used for any move including Berserker placements

## Strategic Tips

1. **Controlled Chaos**:
   - Think short-term; long-term plans rarely survive
   - Stay flexible and watch for tactical opportunities
   - Time your "Berserker Rising" and "Oh no!" options carefully - your King's life depends on it

## Victory Scoring

- Regular Checkmate: **1 point**
- Berserker Checkmate: **2 points**
- Draw: **Â½ point** each

## Making Up Your Own Rules

- The creator of Berserker Chess invented these rules in an attempt to make the game fun and balanced. However, he admits to not playing a single game other than in his head and discussing positional strategies with Large Language Models.

- The creator openly invites rule modifications, though it would be nice to ensure they maintain game balance.

- There is a Prime Directive in force for rule changes, especially if adopted as official:

**Prime Directive:**
The Berserker piece must remain a Knight, it must be immortal, and the game must be playable on a regular chess board with regular pieces. The size of the board could be restricted (for example, for a children's version or a less complex version) by putting masking tape around the squares. The number of pieces used could be reduced, but the basic rules of movement must remain the same for other pieces. Other than that, rule changes are up to the community that might develop.
